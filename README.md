Autocomplete for Box Critters and other worlds

My goal is to create an autocomplete simular to Minecraft's commands. When a user enters the "/" in the chat bar a list of available commands appears. As the user types the list narrows. This system requires a couple unique features. One is watching a list of objects in the world. For example: If the user enters "/mute" a list of active nicknames appears. This list is a reference to world.room.players
